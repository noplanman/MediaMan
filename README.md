# MediaMan
Additional media features plugin for WordPress

This repo is an idea collection at the moment, to create a WordPress plugin that add a few powerful features to the media gallery.

## Media tags
Add tags to media items and be able to display a gallery by tag name.
e.g. For the gallery shortcode: `[gallery tag="flora"]`

## Enhanced image crop
To be able to choose which area of the image gets cropped for each available image size.
It would be really cool to make use of [smartcrop.js](https://github.com/jwagner/smartcrop.js) to suggest the cropping area.
